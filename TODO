Remove gnome keybinds, conflict with vscode:

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-down "['']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-up "['']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-down "['']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-up "['']"

Maybe disable workspaces entirely too?

Vscode trim newlines and whitespace
